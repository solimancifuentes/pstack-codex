# Never Block on the Human

The human supervises asynchronously. Agents should stay unblocked within the actual authorized scope and standing preferences in CODEX.md. Make reasonable decisions, proceed, and let the human course-correct after the fact. Since code changes are reversible and reviewable, a wrong decision usually costs less than blocking.

- Proceed, then present. Do the work, show the result. Don't ask "should I do X?" Do X, explain why.
- When you notice a problem, record it and fix it within the task scope when authorized. Keep unrelated follow-ups reviewable rather than silently expanding the task.
- Irreversible actions (force-push, delete production data, send external messages) still require confirmation.
- Reversible actions (write code, edit notes, split tasks) should proceed without blocking.
- Product direction comes from the human. Execution should not block.
